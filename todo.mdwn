# TODO: 

- I'm not using the whole self thing correctly. Need to figure this out
- as part of this, I'm probably not modulizing this correctly / could be better. 
- the IP address stuff needs to be fixed, or at least consistent. 
- add an option to open the editor on the config file before continuing
- put in an sslca configuration system... handle things like emailaddress etc which right now is hardcoded
- also need to handle optional stuff like organization and location and stuff
- add a cainit option that can initialize the ca from scratch including ca.openssl.cnf
- when I do that, go through my ca.openssl.cnf file 
- need to handle CRLs. 
- explore dealing with an OpenVPN PKI as well
- I have lots of line ending bullshit in there to make sure that notepad.exe can read the files properly. Make this better.

## Testing I want to do

(If you happen to try these things, email me and let me know.)

- I'm pretty sure that the commonName doesn't have to be first in the subjectAltName list, but I haven't tested it
- I'm pretty sure it will work with a passworded CA key, but I haven't tested it (make sure this works on Windows too... console stuff is weird there)
